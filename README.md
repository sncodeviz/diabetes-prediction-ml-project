## Overview
This healthcare analytics-themed project analyzes a real-world clinical dataset to develop a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on basic health and demographic features. 
Using a structured predictive analytics workflow, the project examines factors such as age, BMI, blood glucose level, and Hemoglobin A1 that contribute to diabetes risk. The project demonstrates the full lifecycle of applied data science, from raw data to actionable insights, while also highlighting the importance of model interpretability, ethical considerations, and responsible machine learning use in health-related analytics.
